### About Pcryt
At the moment, Pcryt is highly simplified and minimalistic.

### Running Pcryt
###### For v0.1.2
__1. Command Line Method__
##### Single Message Encryption/Decryption
Use the following command in the command line interface. Replace the "MESSAGE" with the text you want to encrypt, replace "SEED" with a binary value, e.g. 110010, and the "TAPPOSITION" can be a number less than the maximum number of digits in the SEED you enter.
```python
python lfsr.py MESSAGE SEED TAPPOSITION
```
Use the following command to initiate "mass decrypting" mode.
```python
python lfsr.py _attemptall_ SEED
```
##### Text File Encryption/Decryption
Use the following command in the command line interface.
 ```python
 python lfsr_auto.py SEED TAPPOSITION
 ```
__2. Instruction Method__
##### Single Message Encryption/Decryption
 Launch the "pcryt_launcher.bat" file. Instructions are presented step-by-step.
##### Text File Encryption
 Launch the "pcryt_encrypt.bat" file. Nothing else to do. It uses a default seed and tapposition automatically.

###### For earlier versions
Use the following command in the command line interface. Replace the "MESSAGE" with the text you want to encrypt, and the TAPPOSITION can be a number between 0-5
```python
python lfsr.py MESSAGE TAPPOSITION
```
Use the following command to initiate "mass decrypting" mode.
```python
python lfsr.py attemptall 5
```
