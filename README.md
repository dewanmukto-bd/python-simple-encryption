### About Pcryt
At the moment, Pcryt is highly simplified and minimalistic.

### Running Pcryt
Use the following command in the command line interface. Replace the "MESSAGE" with the text you want to encrypt, and the TAPPOSITION can be a number between 0-5
```python
python lfsr.py MESSAGE TAPPOSITION
```
Use the following command to initiate "mass decrypting" mode.
```python
python lfsr.py attemptall 5
```
